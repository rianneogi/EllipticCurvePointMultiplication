# Elliptic Curve Point Multiplication

This repository contains code for the Crypto project on Elliptic Curve Point Multiplication in Fortran.

elliptic_finite_field contains code to do elliptic curve point multiplication over finite fields modulo some prime p, where as elliptic_reals contains code to do elliptic curve point multiplication over fthe field of reals.
